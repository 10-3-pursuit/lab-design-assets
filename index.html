        My name is Jose Barrios. I am a web developer located in North Bergen, New Jersey. I have aspirations of becoming an A.I. architect, hopefully, I'm headed in the right direction. I am passionate about learning how things work. There have been nights when I stay awake trying to figure out the way something functions, be it something mechanical, biological, or something intangible.

        Something interesting about me is I've been interested in astronomy as a child. I used to read books written by Lawrence Krauss and listen to Dr. Michio Kaku's lectures. In a perfect world, I would've been an astronomer.

      <h4>Work Experience</h4>
      <br>
      My first job was as a <span id="color-word1">customer service agent</span> for <span id="color-word1">American Airlines</span>. After that I landed a job at a company called <span id="color-word1">Macerich</span>, which is the company that controls/operates all the malls in New York. After working as an <span id="color-word1">EMT</span> a short while after that, I returned to school briefly, and have been working at <span id="color-word1">Home Depot ever since</span>.
